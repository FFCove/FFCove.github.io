            <p> Robber crabs (also widely known as coconut crabs) are a fascinating beast. The largest land crab in the world, they can grow to 1 meter in width (leg span) and weigh up to 5 kilograms.<br><br> Found on islands across the Indian and Pacific oceans they are a fearsome sight. They look like a monster from outer space or something seen in a nightmare. In fact they pose no threat to humans whatsoever, unless someone is careless enough to get  caught by their massive nippers. Robber crabs have no predators except for other robber crabs and humans.

                The crabs have been widely hunted due to their large size and the quality of their meat. Numbers have decreased dramatically on islands with a human population and they are now protected to some extent in many areas. They are a vulnerable species.<br><br> The largest and wholly protected colony of robber crabs is on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, where they are outnumbered 50 to 1 by the Christmas Island red crab.<br><br>
                
                This site is about Christmas Island, its flora and fauna, its human history and future and some fictional tales based on the Island.<br><br> I hope you enjoy reading my stories and I welcome contributions from anyone with a tale about the island. Please click the contribute button at the top of the page if you would like to submit content for consideration.
